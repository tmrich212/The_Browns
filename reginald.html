                Reginald or 'Red' was born on March 23, 1931 in Albermarle, VA to parents Mollie
                and Thomas Brown. He was one of 12 children and would soon go on to make a big family 
                of his own. After meeting his soon-to-be wife Alice Robinson, he would enlist in the 
                United States Military on July 22, 1950. Rising through the ranks quickly he served in the 25th Infantry 
                Division, 2nd Battalion and earned the title of Master Sergeant. He would find himself a 
                part of the Allied Invasion of Inchon, South Korea for 11 months. Most of which were spent
                in foxholes. Though as he tells it, he returned without a scratch. Throughout the years he would
                become an ordained deacon and serve the church for over 45 years. His accomplishments didn't stop
                there. He was also the first African American Vice Mayor for his hometown, Gordonsville, VA. He served 
                for 4 years and another 10 on the town council. He was dedicated to making his town a better place.

           Reginald, or papa as I know him, was always level-headed and steady in his nature.
           As I remember him, you could always find him outside birdwatching, listening to jazz,
           or simply taking a walk and enjoying the world around him. I remember him picking me up 
           from school as a child and we would count the planes and jets as they flew by. His laugh 
           was contagious and quite unique once you got him going. There wasn't anything he wouldn't 
           do to make us happy. I remember asking for a seesaw and getting a cenderblock and board. We 
           had fun all the same.

            One thing you could always count on was papa enjoying his food. He loved to eat and it made
            cooking for him an even bigger pleasure. He didn't descriminate, if it was good he would eat it
            and we always had something good to eat. I can still hear him scolding me for making his cheddar
            slices too small. There's a story that stays with me about Papa getting his wisdom teeth out and 
            asking for pork chops and gravy for dinner. He left nothing on his plate. I remember cooking for 
            him one morning and telling him "You know I love you with all my heart, right?" and he said "Oh 
            yeahhh, I know you do and I love you too, with every bone in my body."
