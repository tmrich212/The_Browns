	                        As the story goes, a young Reginald was on the school bus when he looked out 
	                        the window to see a beautiful girl in a red coat with long black hair that fell in braids down her back, he 
	                        would later find out her name was Alice. He couldn't help but think about how much he 
	                        wanted to know who she was. Unable to reach out to her himself, he asked around and found 
	                        that he knew her cousin. This cousin soon became the messenger to a party invite where
	                        they would finally meet for the first time. After only a few moments of getting to know one 
	                        another Reginald would go on to proclaim "You're going to be my wife someday."  Which resulted
	                        in a scoff from Alice, but it turns out he was right.

	                <p> 
	                   Reginald, or Red (a nickname product of his red hair), would turn out to be correct.
	                   He proposed and they were married at the young age of 19 and would later grow a big family
	                   of two sons and 5 daughters. Married April 13, 1951. He had been courting her for 4 years
	                   since meeting in high school. Used to ride bus from gordonsville to lightfoot tradeschool.
	                   She fell behind in her classes after breaking her leg and as the bus stopped to lt people
	                   cross he saw her. She had a red winter coat, and hair down her back. Reginald would
	                   send notes to her through her cousin. And one day he got the invite to a party where they 
	                   finally would meet.
